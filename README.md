# DS-Server

In order to correspond to the requirements of the ABXYZ company, this report describes a multi-user, multi-threaded chat system. The system chose to use the Python programming language and TCP socket technology. It is designed and architected using a client-server architecture. The system is divided into a server side and multiple clients, where the server side and the clients can interact in a stable manner. The socket technology I chose to use is TCP because of its stability and reliability.
This software is a multi-threaded, multi-channel, multi-client chat software. The software enables multiple clients to chat publicly, send private messages to selected users, and join a specific channel for chatting. And there are some treatments for scalability, transparency, and effective troubleshooting is also added. This presentation focuses on the design aspects of the system including system architecture, UML diagrams and necessary explanations and assumptions made during the development process.
